This repository consists of three projects. 

**The first project** aims to provide tools for developing software capable of supervising the driver and detecting dangerous behaviors caused by distraction or drowsiness. Statistical analysis has shown that these are the most common causes of car accidents, and a system to prevent them would be of significant importance. This initial project utilizes Mediapipe, an open-source machine learning tool developed by Google, primarily used in the field of computer vision. When combined with OpenCV, it enables the processing of video streams to detect facial landmarks.
