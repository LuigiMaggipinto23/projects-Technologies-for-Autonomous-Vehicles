# projects-Technologies-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

This repository consists of three projects:

**The first project** aims to provide tools for developing software capable of supervising the driver and detecting dangerous behaviors caused by distraction or drowsiness. Statistical analysis has shown that these are the most common causes of car accidents, and a system to prevent them would be of significant importance. This initial project utilizes Mediapipe, an open-source machine learning tool developed by Google, primarily used in the field of computer vision. When combined with OpenCV, it enables the processing of video streams to detect facial landmarks. 

**The second project** aims to depict the longitudinal dynamics of a rear-wheel-drive electric passenger car: using Matlab and Simulink (for simulations), we developed an electric vehicle model, subjecting it to several tests, which are described and documented in the corresponding report.

**The third project** using Matlab and Simulink (for simulations), we have implemented a single-track model, of a vehicle, suitable for lane keeping and path tracking control, and we have discussed the vehicle's behaviour along different curvature profiles. The system is modelled through a linear state-space formulation and, in addition, a linear state feedback controller,including a feedforward contribution, is designed to stabilize the vehicle dynamics and ensure it keeps the lane and follows the desired path accurately. In the corresponding report we have discussed results analysis for various operative conditions.
